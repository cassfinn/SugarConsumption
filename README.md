# SugarConsumption

Pulling data about world-wide sugar consumption from Gapminder.org, show average daily consumption of people in the United States over time (1961-2004) and compared with other countries.

Conclusion:  From 1984-2004 the consumption of sugar increased about 25%. By 2004 the US had the highest average daily consumption rate of sugar.  It would be interesting to see if there is a correlation between the increases in sugar consumption and the increases in obesity among the US population in that same time period.
